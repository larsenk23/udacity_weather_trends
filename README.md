This project was created as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. It examines the differences between the average temperature change between Columbus, Ohio and the global temperatures from 1787-2013.

The Udacity Weather Trends PDF shows the steps that I took to extract the data and create my comparison.

The extract_data file displays the SQL code used to extract the relevant data for comparison.
